# 2D_Rendering_Assignment_Prototype
A Prototype of an assignment meant to be used in 15-462 at Carnegie Mellon University.

#Implicit Image Generation

#Explicit IFS Rendering

#Piecewise 2D Geometry Rendering

#legacy
This assignment was never used for the course, but the Iterated Function System portion of it was included as an option for the final project.

This assignment will also probably be a useful step in the development of a wonderful semester of computer art with Project Ignite:
